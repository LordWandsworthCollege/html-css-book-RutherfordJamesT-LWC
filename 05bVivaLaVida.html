<p class="verse">I used to rule the world<br>
    Seas would rise when I gave the word<br>
    Now in the morning, I sleep alone<br>
    Sweep the streets I used to own<br>
    I used to roll the dice<br>
    Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes<br>
    Listen as the crowd would sing<br>
    Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!<br>One minute I held the key<br>
    Next the walls were closed on me<br>
    And I discovered that my castles stand<br>
    Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand</p>
<p class="chorus">I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing<br>
    Roman Cavalry choirs are singing<br>
    Be my mirror, my sword and shield<br>
    My missionaries in a foreign field<br>
    For some reason I can't explain<br>
    Once you go there was never, never an honest word,<br>And that was when I ruled the world</p>
<p class="verse">It was a wicked and wild wind<br>
    Blew down the doors to let me in<br>
    Shattered windows and the sound of drums<br>
    People couldn't believe what I'd become<br>
    Revolutionaries wait
    For my head on a silver plate<br>
    Just a puppet on a lonely string<br>
    Oh, who would ever want to be king?</p>
<p class="chorus">I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing<br>
    Roman Cavalry choirs are singing<br>
    Be my mirror, my sword and shield<br>
    My missionaries in a foreign field<br>
    For some reason I can't explain<br>
    Once you go there was never, never an honest word,<br>And that was when I ruled the world</p>
<p class="verse">Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</p>
<p class="chorus">I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing<br>
    Roman Cavalry choirs are singing<br>
    Be my mirror, my sword and shield<br>
    My missionaries in a foreign field<br>
    For some reason I can't explain<br>
    Once you go there was never, never an honest word,<br>And that was when I ruled the world</p>
